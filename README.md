- 👋 Hi, I’m @Birdsong-Interactive
- I'm a Canadian indie game developer and streamer.
- You can catch me live on Twitch Wednesday to Sunday 7:30AM PST for about 6 hours!
- https://www.twitch.tv/birdsong_technology 🐦



-I'm makking a 3D squad based roguelike where you outrun monsters that have just destroyed your home village, leaving very few survivors. 
-You are an apprentice wizard from a small village. 
-You have lost much, as have your fellow villagers. Friends, family, loved ones, your homes.
- There is still one hope, however. The local lord may be able to protect you. If you can only reach their fortress.
- You must make it. At any cost.


- 💞️ I’m looking for any advice or tips along this process
